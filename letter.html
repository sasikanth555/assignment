    <h2>Subjects to Study</h2>
    <p>At the Awesome Science Facility, We have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the subjects fall
        somewhere in realm of science and technology.
        You seem like an intelligent,dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our
        team.Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most
        intrigued by as follows,in order of priority:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine,and the health benefits of
                Resveratrol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Measuring the effect of funk baseplayeer at temperatures exceeding 30<sup>o</sup>C(86<sup>o</sup>F),When
                the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> increasing into 3 x
                10<sup>4</sup>)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b><abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr></b> and <b><abbr
                        title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr></b> Constructs for representing musical scores.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the
        reaseach to take,required staff and other resources,and anything else you would think we'd need to know? Thanks.
    </p>
    <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of post-doctorate work,I <em>did</em> study exotic tribal dances. To anser your
        question,
        my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
    <p>Polynesean chicken dance</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>A little known,but<em>very</em>influential dance dating back as far as <b>300<abbr title="before Christ">BC</abbr></b>,a whole village would
            dance around in a circle like chickens,
            to encourge their livestock to be <q>fruitful</q></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Icelandic brownian shuffle</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm,they used to practice this dance,which
            involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor,and shuffle their bodies around in imperceptibly
            tiny,very rapid movements.One of my yellow students used to say that he thought
            this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Arctic robot dance</p>
    <blockquote>An interesting example of historic misinformation,English exploreres in 1960s believed to have
        discovered a new dance style characterised by <q>robotic</q> stlited movements,being practiced by inhabitants of
        Northenr Alaska and Canada.Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they
        were really cold.</blockquote>
